## Script Sandbox

I'm finally getting serious with Python and have added this repository to hold some miscellaneous scripts I create while studying the language.

## Microsoft Access script launching app (Python Scripts.accdb)

8/28/2025 - See https://youtu.be/o1IjeGaaoro for the companion video. This was a small project for launching Python scripts from Access and then connecting a results file back to Access.

## HTMLSearch.py

11/15/2025 - This is a script that uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML files and extract specific information to the screen or an optional output file.
